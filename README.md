## CycleGAN (implemented in Keras 2.0)
#### currently works only with 2D images [tested]
---
[TODO] port the code to work with 3D images (nifti to begin with)
[TODO] implement model test function
[TODO] train the GAN to predict T2w from T1w, and T2w from T1w
[TODO] find ~optimal hyper-parameters

---

The official version of implementation is published in [Here](https://github.com/junyanz/CycleGAN).
Check `basic_usage.py` for the usage.
